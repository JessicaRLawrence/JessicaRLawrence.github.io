				<h3>Student-centered learning</h3>
					<p>A mentor from my undergraduate university taught according to the quote, “Tell me and I will forget, show me and I may remember, involve me and I will understand.” In other words, for astudent to achieve the highest levels of learning outcomes, they must be included in their ownlearning. As an educator, I believe it is essential to use teaching strategies that create an environmentwhere students are exploring the material. I also incorporate thisphilosophy in my classroom by using strategies such as think–pair–share and small group discussion, which encourage students to engage actively with the content. By working in pairs or small groups, students canarticulate their thoughts, challenge each other’s ideas, and collaboratively construct knowledge.This not only deepens their understanding but also builds essential communication and criticalthinking skills which can carry over into other fields of study. Furthermore, I strive to create a safe space where questions are welcomed,and mistakes are viewed as valuable learning opportunities.</p>
				<h3>Innovative instruction</h3>
					<p>As an instructor, one of the most important things I can do for my students is break downcomplicated concepts in new ways which students are able to understand and relate to. Thisapproach is crucial because many students struggle with abstract ideas or technical jargon thatoften accompany physics. For example, using analogies and real-world examples allow studentsto understand new material in terms of what they already know from their own life experiences.This connection not only aids in comprehension but also makes learning more engaging andrelevant. By combiningvarious teaching methods and connecting new material to familiar contexts, I aim to create adynamic learning environment where all students can thrive and feel confident in their abilityto master challenging subjects.</p>
				<h3>Continuous development</h3>
					<p>As an instructor, I endeavor to continuously refine my teaching practices, recognizing that thereis always potential for growth and improvement. I pursue my professional development throughself-reflection, collaboration with colleagues, and by actively seeking feedback from my students. 
</p><p>
I frequently reflect on every aspect of my classroom practice, fromthe initial stages of developing and delivering lectures to the critical process of designing assessments. This reflective practice allows me to systematically evaluate what works well and whatmay not resonate with my students. </li>
</p><p>
Collaboration with colleagues is highly important to me, as sharing insights and strategiesenriches our collective teaching practices. By discussing our approaches and challenges, wecan learn from one another, gaining new perspectives and ideas that can enhance our instruction.
</p><p>
Welcoming feedback from students is also essential to my growth as an educator. Byactively seeking their insights and perspectives, I gain a deeper understanding of their needsand preferences, allowing me to adapt my teaching methods accordingly. It is imperative to methat my students leave the course with a genuine appreciation for the subject and a sense offulfillment from their experience. Thus, creating an environment where students feel comfortablesharing their thoughts and experiences allows me to modify my teaching practices to each groupof students, ultimately benefiting their education.
